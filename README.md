Budget Tracker is an application that allows the user to keep track of their fininaces by adding and subtracting expenses the user makes. The user is allowed to make their expense adjustments on and offline in order to always have the ability to adjust their finances to their needs.

The application utilizes progressive web app functionality. By hitting the circular plus icon located to the right of the search bar a desktop application of the program is created and can be utilized in the exact same way as the web version. The application also uses manifests and web services that allows the user to have the functionlity without being connected to the internet and will save the information that was inserted for when the device is reconnected to the internet.

This project was very interesting to work on. I found it really cool to add the offline capabilities and create my first pwa application.
